                        <li>&#8220;Sir, I am come before God and before you for the sake of God and our dear Lady, to admit me into your Society, and the good deeds of the Order, as one who will be all his life long servant and slave of the Order.&#8221; </li>
                        <li>&#8220;Beloved brother,&#8221; answered the receptor, &#8220;you are desirous of a great matter for you see nothing but the outward shell of our Order. It is only the outward shell when you see
                          that we have fine horses and rich caparisons, that we eat and drink well and are splendidly clothed. From this you conclude that you will be well off with us. But you know not rigorous maxims which are in our interior. For it is a hard matter for you, who are your own master, to become the servant of another. You will hardly be able to perform, in future, what you wish yourself. For when you may wish to be on this side of the sea, you will be sent to the other side; when you will wish to be in Acre, you will be sent to the district of Antioch, to Tripolis, or to Armenia; or you will be sent to Apulia, to Sicily, or to Lombardy, or to Burgundy, France, England, or any other country where we have houses and possessions. When you will wish to sleep, you will be ordered to watch; when you will wish to watch, then you will be ordered to go to bed; when you will wish to eat, then you will be ordered to do something else. And as both we and you might suffer great inconvenience from what you have mayhap concealed from us, look here on the holy evangelists and the word of God and answer the truth to the questions which we shall put to you; for if you lie you will be perjured, and may be expelled the Order, from which God keep you!&#8221; </li>

Following the doctrines of demons, they affix their cross of their Order upon the breast of every kind of scoundrel, asserting that whoever by paying two or three pence a year became one of their fraternity could not, even if interdicted, be deprived of Christian burial . . . and thus they themselves, being captive to the devil, cease not to make captive the souls of the faithful, seeking to make alive those whom they knew to be dead . . .&#8221;</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1. Each Templar on his admission swore never to quit the Order, and to further its interests by right or wrong.</li>
            <li>2. The heads of the Order are in secret alliance with the Saracens, and they have more of Mohammedan infidelity than Christian faith. 
              <ul>
                <li>Proof of the latter includes that they make every novice spit upon the cross and trample upon it
                  <ul>
                    <li>blaspheme the faith of Christ in various ways.</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>3. The heads of the Order are heretical, cruel and sacrilegious men. Whenever any novice, on discovering the iniquity of the Order, tries to leave it, they kill him and bury the body secretly by night. They teach women who are pregnant by them how to procure abortion, and secretly murder such newborn children.</li>
            <li>4. They are infected with the errors of the Fratecelli; they despise the Pope and the authority of the Church; they scorn the sacraments, especially those of penance and confession. They pretend to comply with the rites of the Church simply to avoid detection.</li>
            <li>5. The superiors are addicted to the most infamous excesses of debauchery. If anyone expresses his repugnance to this, he is punished by perpetual captivity.</li>
            <li>6. The Temple-houses are the receptacle of every crime and abomination that can be committed.</li>
            <li>7. The Order works to put the Holy Land into the hands of the Saracens, and favors them more than the Christians.</li>
            <li>8. The Master is installed in secret and few of the younger brethren are present at this ceremony. It is strongly suspected that on this occasion he repudiates the Christian faith, or does something contrary to right.</li>
            <li>9. Many statutes of the Order are unlawful, profane and contrary to Christianity. [In fact, some of them are stone penises.] The members are therefore forbidden under pain of perpetual confinement to reveal them to anyone.</li>
            <li>10. No vice or crime committed for the honor or benefit of the Order is held to be a sin.</li>

They spat and trampled upon the cross, especially on Good Friday. They worshiped a cat, which sometimes appeared in their chapters. Their priests, when celebrating Mass, did not pronounce the words of consecration. They believed that their Master could absolve them from their sins. They were told at their reception that they might abandon themselves to all kinds of licentiousness. They have idols in all their provinces, some with three faces, some with one. They worshiped these idols in their chapters, believed that they could save them, regarded them as the givers of wealth to the order and of the fertility to the earth; they touched them with cords which they afterwards tied around their own bodies. Those who at the time of their reception would not comply with these practices were put to death or imprisoned.&#8221;
