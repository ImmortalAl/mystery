<p>England, 1640s. The Civil War just ended. The king lost his head. Parliament won. Power changed hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That's the official version.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two radical movements emerge during this period: the Levellers and the Diggers. Both push for rights that sound reasonable now but were considered revolutionary then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Levellers advocate for a written constitution. England still doesn't have one. They also demand expanded voting rights, religious freedom, and equality before the law. Dangerous ideas for the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Diggers go further. They're proto-communists who occupy unused land and start farming it. Their core belief: natural resources shouldn't be private property. They don't just theorize about this. They actually dig and plant. Hence the name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both movements get crushed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cromwell's army suppresses the Levellers. Local landowners destroy the Diggers' communes. Order is restored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>History books tell us these movements "failed" but planted seeds for future reforms. It's the standard narrative: brave radicals fighting tyranny, paving the way for progress, making the world better for generations to come.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An inspiring story about the march toward freedom.</p>
