    <li>when Christ was born, the Sun at Vernal Equinox crossed the equator in the sign of Aries
      <ul>
        <li>some say the sign was Pisces
          <ul>
            <li>symbol should have been fish</li>
            </ul>

<li>Caiaphas
  <ul>
    <li>said he was going to utilize Jesus Christ as a scapegoat to rescuef the Jewish nation
      <ul>
        <li>Jesus was only sent to save the Jewish nation
          <ul>
            <li>discouraged apostles from engaging gentiles</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Satan's role is to accuse Jews of their sins
                      <ul>
                        <li>when goat given to Satan on Yom Kipur, Satan would stop accusing Jews of their sins that 1 day and accuse the gentiles of all their sins for the previous year.</li>
                        <li>that's what Jesus did, accuse the Jews of their sins to their god Yahweh
                          <ul>
                            <li>to stop Jesus from accusing, they had to sacrifice him on the cross to his father Satan so Satan would stop accusing the Jews
                              <ul>
                                <li>the Jews could then resume their ritual of atonement without their intercessor accusing them of their sins
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>all of those sins would be placed on the gentiles for 2000 years because they would come to worship the son of Satan who had accepted this scapegoat, Jesus, his own son as a sin offering
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>the Jews then made the gentiles the perpetual scapegoat to Satan through Jesus through Pisces the Christian era</li>
